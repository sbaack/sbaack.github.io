### Best article of the year 2018 in the peer-reviewed journal _Digital Journalism_

The _Digital Journalism Editorial Team_ chose my article _[Practically Engaged. The entanglements between data journalism and civic tech](https://doi.org/10.1080/21670811.2017.1375382)_ as article of the year 2018. Among other things, the team found that my article stands out "in its success at combining empirical work with theory development." The [announcement](https://www.facebook.com/journalismstudies/posts/digital-journalism-best-article-of-the-year-based-on-nominations-by-editorial-bo/1342088079263962/) says:

> The article thus manages to advance our knowledge of important changes in the digital frontiers, while at the same time building on existing knowledge in journalism studies and about journalism as a space of practice. His [Baack's] conceptual framework will be useful for future research into the boundaries of journalism, journalism practice, and practice theory including how journalistic actors coordinate digital news work with other social actors, and the increasingly ‘entangled’ ways these actors and their practices interact."The Digital Journalism Editorial Team chose my article "Practically Engaged.
