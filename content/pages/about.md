I have a background in media and journalism studies and published about data practices and data cultures across different industries. At the Mozilla Foundation, where I worked as a senior researcher, I studied data governance and AI training data datasets, and supported the organization's ongoing campaigns and policy work. I also supported the [Internet Health Report](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/insights/internet-health-report/) and the [IRL podcast](https://irlpodcast.org/) with fact-checking, reviewing and proposing research publications and data visualizations to include. Before Mozilla, I completed a PhD at the research center for media and journalism studies at the [University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/), where I wrote a [dissertation](https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/knowing-what-counts-how-journalists-and-civic-technologists-use-a) about the relationship between data journalism and civic tech. I have also been a fellow at the [Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society](https://www.hiig.de/), as well as a fellow and associate researcher the [Weizenbaum Institute](https://www.weizenbaum-institut.de/), where I studied transnational collaborations and the role of leaks in investigate journalism.

I mostly employ qualitative methods (interviews, ethnography), but also have experience in quantitative methods like surveys or [Digital Methods](https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/). My research has been published in journals such as _Big Data & Society_ and _Digital Journalism_.
