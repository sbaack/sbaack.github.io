I'm working as a research and data analyst for the [Mozilla Foundation's Insights Team](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/insights/) and am an associated researcher at the '[Digitalisation and the Transnational Public Sphere](https://www.weizenbaum-institut.de/en/research/rg15/)' research group at the Weizenbaum Institute.

At the Mozilla Foundation, I support the [Internet Health Report](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/insights/internet-health-report/) and currently focus on researching [alternative data governance](https://foundation.mozilla.org/en/data-futures-lab/data-for-empowerment/). My research broadly asks how datafication affects democratic visions and practices. With 'datafication' I do not simply mean that more and more aspects of our social life are being quantified, but that the ways in which data is perceived and understood is changing. In my [dissertation](https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/knowing-what-counts-how-journalists-and-civic-technologists-use-a), I studied the practices and imaginaries of data journalists and activists in the open data and civic tech movement. In addition, I study the transnational collaborations and the role of leaks in journalism.

I mostly employ qualitative methods (interviews, ethnography), but also have experience in quantitative methods like surveys or [Digital Methods](https://wiki.digitalmethods.net/). My [research](/pages/publications.html) has been published in journals such as _Big Data & Society_ and _Digital Journalism_.<a rel="me" href="https://mozilla.social/@tootbaack"></a>
